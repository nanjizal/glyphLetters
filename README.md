glyph letters for languages

Simple concept be defining char set and providing a simple keyboard mapping can remap keypresses.

Implemented Modern Greek. Took a long time to establish minimum characters, not all characters are mapped, lightly would need tweeking for real use to remember if a modifier key was used and perhaps some similar files to allow remapping to other defaults
